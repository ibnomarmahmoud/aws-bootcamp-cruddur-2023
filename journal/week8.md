Also Route 53 for our hosted zone was updated so that assets.eg-cruddur.online is being resolved as the Cloud Front

I sticked to the initial implemnetation and didn't create a seperate bucket for processed avatars and another for Avatar uploads , Lambda function was triggered successfully

One issue faced , It was not showing any info related to the User as backend was complaining about the non existing "bio" field in users table 

```
psycopg.errors.UndefinedColumn: column users.bio does not exist
LINE 10:       users.bio,
```

Before proceeding further in the video and the use of the migration script to add the Bio column , I have modified the schema to include this bio field and it worked as shown above but migration scripts had been updated anyway and the setup script was modified as well
