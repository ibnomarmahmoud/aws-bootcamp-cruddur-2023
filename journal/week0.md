I have added 25$ Credit acquired from attending an AWSomeDay earlier accordingly I created a budget to track my spendings with a budget of 25 USD per monty and two alerts towards my personal email one at 50% and another at 80% , Another budget would be added in a later stage to track specfic service usage
