### Cognito User Pool Creation 
The User pool was created from AWS console as per the Live stream instructions and the user pool ID , Client ID under App integartion were updated in the application code so that the authetication is done via AWS Cognito

The same was checked/verified  via AWS CloudTrail as witnessed afterwards from Ashish's video

Upon Signing-out , one user requested recovering the password and the verification Code was sent correctly

### JWT Different approaches  

The related video was watched but it was not properly digested so I prefered to read more about such topic from external resources and enhance my coding experience specially for Flask and re-do the backend implementation for Cognito part once more instead of copying the backend modified .py files specially this is not dependant on the next steps

## Homework Challenges  

I have attempted the challenge of creating a new User Pool with MFA as SMS message

Its spending consideration was checked and the SMS containing the OTP for Egypt various operators will be costing the below fees

This was not applied in the Frontend end code to avoid actual money spending
