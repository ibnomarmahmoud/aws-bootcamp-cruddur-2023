### Configure CodeBuild 

The instructions had been followed and Codebuild configuration was done successfully , initially it was failing even after Beko's fixes and appearently Codebuild couldn't push to ECR with the below error 

```

So I had to add the below policy to CodeBuild role

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
                "ecr:PutImage"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

It is shown below that the built had been done successfully
