![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
### Preparations 

Post the Live stream and after Andrew declared that the week may have some spendings since Fargate is not covered in the Free Tier , I suddenly received a mail from AWS because of the new account and a submit request that I am building an application like Twitter as part of Andrew's bootcamp and I have received 300$ credits :)

So I tested the connection from the local backend container before pushing to ECR

### Implemnet Health-check API and script

The health check was tested and it was working fine , the issue is that I forgot it since it was missed in week-6-again repo and had to re-do all coming steps once more after having the ECS Cluster running due to missing the health check scripts and once I did the re-built again , I forgot to make the script executable

### ECS Cluster Creation

As a pre-step , I have set all the environmnetal variables and exported them to gitpod

<img width="941" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228811013-6f2f0caf-5f83-41e9-b2c2-225649b3de7c.png">

The namespace was created and the ECS cluster was provisioned

### Create ECR repo and push image for backend-flask

The repo was created 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228834470-7258ba6e-9c05-4a94-aea7-9b32e3a5c80a.png)
The Python image was pushed to ECR , initially the base image was pulled from Docker hub , tagged and pushed back to the private repo after login to ECR

### Have Cloudwatch Logging group created before task definition 

Found it created since the Lamdbda function so just updated the retension 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228845152-4c848415-749d-4103-9a50-e91080c43877.png)

### Passing the sensitive data to SSM instead of the Secret Manager to avoid paying money before the backend task definition 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228847608-06db3dc2-8253-4617-bcf2-80a097c582d2.png)

### Creating the Backend task definition 

After all previous step , I have created the backend task 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228859364-b3a48163-f1ff-42d2-8c64-42a00db99619.png)

## Deploy Backend Flask app as a service to Fargate

The task was created but it kept on failing due to the roles and the missing health check script as previouslly mentioned 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228873734-b2bfbb7f-c1b8-47b2-b809-51541e83cfca.png)

But after fixing the roles and rebuilding with the health-checks , finally it stabilized :tada:

It shown here that it kept starting and stopping

### Create ECR repo and push image for fronted-react-js

The instructions were followed and the image was pushed to ECR

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/229377231-83d65bdf-697e-4380-b503-e4301e04b312.png)

### Deploy Frontend React JS app as a service to Fargate

The Service was deployed successfully but this was done after updating the definitions to include the Load balancer for both backend and frontend 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228968914-c51866ae-ef5b-40bb-ae93-25cc3c7b543d.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
### Provision and configure Application Load Balancer along with target groups

Both Target groups were created and the tasks were registered successfully and showed healthy status 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228968966-8fc8c7ec-876e-4df0-9dda-34000b1797e2.png)

Then I tested accessing the frontend from the loadbalancer endpoint 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228969122-f2334b9f-757b-47e6-ba9f-b24cf3ffecdd.png)

And for the Backend , it was accessed successfully after allowing port 4567 with Task public IP provided by ENI

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/228905212-a9c4cb35-db8d-4f4a-bbe1-057139631187.png)

Then after adding the ALB and application Load Balancer , it is now accessible

### Domain Registration
I didn't create it previouslly since I didn't know earlier whether it would be covered by the AWS Credits or not and what would be its best name so I created it from GoDaddy this week ( eg-cruddur.online )
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/229273016-8d1d0fdf-8de3-41ca-87a2-62e21121a4f6.png)

### Manage your domain useing Route53 via hosted zone

Route 53 hosted zone was created for my domain and I had to update the NS in GoDaddy

### Create an SSL cerificate via ACM
I had some issues in issuing the SSL certificate since its status was kept "Pending verifications" till I created a record for it in Route 53 afterwards it was verified but I didn't find it while creating the rule in ALB and it was found to be created in a different region so I deleted it and re-created a new one 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/229284494-0d5750ad-3540-4329-ae40-e7fd029a8324.png)

### Setup a record set for naked domain to point to frontend-react-js and api subdomain to point to the backend-flask

The records were created in Route 53 as shwon below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125532497/229378965-9a0d3606-fea2-4c68-87e8-3960c2d0f908.png)

And both backend and frontend were accessed directly and from my mobile phone as well

Even I tried the Cognito integration and craeted new user from the web version of the application

### Secure Flask by not running in debug mode

A new dockerfile was created with "--no-debugger" and "--no-reload" options as per the instructions but building the new image and updating the task was postponed till fiixng some issues in app.py since week 5

And for the sake of ease of deloying the new image , the below script was created 

```
#! /usr/bin/bash

aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com"
export ECR_BACKEND_FLASK_URL="$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/backend-flask"
echo $ECR_BACKEND_FLASK_URL
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/backend-flask
docker build -t backend-flask .
docker push $ECR_BACKEND_FLASK_URL:latest
cd ..
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://aws/task-definitions/backend-flask.json
```
