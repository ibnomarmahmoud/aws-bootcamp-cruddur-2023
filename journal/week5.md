Update Cognito User ID script as implemented successfully but I had to modify some scripts related to RDS previous week as I had to modify the path after collecting them all under db folder , also I had modified the seed data to the users already existing in my Cognito User Pool so instead of Andrew / Beko , I have inserted Mahmoud / Hema as shown below from the update cognito User ID Output
